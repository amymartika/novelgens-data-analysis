# NovelGens Data Analysis

Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains SQL I've written while working with [NovelGens](https://www.novelgens.com/), a website run by [Indent Labs](https://github.com/indentlabs) that generates fictional creatures using AI.

I'm analyzing the data through SQLiteStudio using spreadsheets provided by Indent Labs. We will be exploring questions such as: 
* How are users responding to the AI-generated content? 
* Which creatures claim superlatives in categories like uniqueness, humor, danger, memorability, and power?
* What trends exist between creatures that share types, tags, and/or environments?
* For each environment, what are the most common emotions associated with its creatures?
* What factors influence how quickly a creature's owner slots fill up? 
* Which creatures most encourage community-submitted stories and artwork?

Feel free to take a look around and [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amymartikabrown/) if you have any questions.
